### Husky's Adventure

Welcome to Husky's Adventure. This is not a game, it is a story of dog who saves his master from getting into any kind of trouble.
Mr. Anderson lost his eyes recently. He likes to wander everywhere and doesn't sit anywhere  idle. He likes to roam here and there. 
He has a husky who loves him and takes care of him in every situation. We need to help Mr. Anderson before he falls of a cliff, 
steps on something dangerous or does something crazy!
